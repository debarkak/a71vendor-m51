# Galaxy A71 vendor for Galaxy M51
this is the modified galaxy a71 vendor to work with the galaxy m51, with this One UI (full-version) features will be enabled, like GoodLock or NiceLock or other features.

### Modified things:
what i did is replace the hw_libs with the galaxy m51 hw_libs, nothing more is modified.
